# Wavefront pathfinding maze solver

Given a pixel map, this algorithm finds the shortest possible path between two points using wavefront algorithm.

## Features

* Finds the shortest path between two points
* Randomly generates mazes
* Low memory usage and fast execution
* Can be used to solve any maze

## Documentation

The report is available [here](./report.pdf)
